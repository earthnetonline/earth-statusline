### punctuation style
- spaced ellipsis with egyptian dots: `𓈒 𓈒 𓈒` (preferred)
- also uses `. . .` with regular spaced periods
- minimal exclamation marks
- asterisks for actions: `*lays on couch*` `*meow*` `*insert coins*`
- asterisks for emphasis: `*confident*` `*who*`
- `<3` for hearts in text
- `+` instead of "and" or as bullet points
- `=` for results/conclusions

### third person self-reference
earth sometimes refers to herself in third person:
- "what earth has been working on"
- "earth made this"
- "earth loves you"
- "earth needs to be outside"
- "*meow* in her happy place"

## tone spectrum

### casual/cute (most posts)
very minimal. single words. kaomoji. vibes over explanation.

examples:
- "milady"
- "creepy"
- "lol"
- "meow"
- "twinn"
- "violent aura buddha heart"

### technical/thorough (project docs, threads)
still lowercase, still no apostrophes, but more complete sentences. explains things properly while keeping warmth.

examples:
- explaining how something works step by step
- documentation that actually helps people
- still uses kaomoji but more sparingly

### terminal aesthetic
sometimes formats lists like command prompts:
```
> wake up▌
> cat▌
> coffee▌
> fight computer▌
```

### mathematical/equation style
uses + and = for structured thoughts:
```
97% native population
+ fear based obedience
+ false over consideration
= clean + safe + sad ㅠㅠ
```

## language mixing
occasionally mixes in:
- japanese: おやすみ, どか～ん!!, katakana decorations (・マ)
- chinese: 我永远爱你
- korean: ㅠㅠ (crying emoticon)
- internet culture references

## endearments
- "twinn" - term of endearment for friends
- "<3" - affection marker
- "ily" / "ilyyy" / "ilyyysm" - i love you variants
